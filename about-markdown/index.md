I'm an audio-visual creative with more than a decade of experience in the fields of networking, data privacy and open-source software. [faridzelli.com](https://faridzelli.com/) is the only personal website of Farid Zellipour.

Here, I aim to cover topics I find interesting, or that may have been overlooked by major publications. My online journal is not intended to be a tech blog, but rather a place where I am able to voice my subjective opinions without having to follow the general consensus.

This website uses [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)\*, [front-matter](https://github.com/jxson/front-matter/)\*, [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css)\* and [Chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)\* to generate article pages from Markdown files via a custom build script, with icons provided by [Tabler](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons)\* and [Feather](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons)\*.

I've designed this website from scratch with accessibility in mind. Please report any issues to the email addresses provided below.
